\section{Project Overview}
MindfulSpace is a comprehensive mental health and mindfulness mobile application developed using React Native and Expo. The application aims to provide users with tools and resources to improve their mental wellbeing through a combination of AI-powered therapy, mindfulness exercises, and professional consultation options. The project integrates modern mobile development technologies with artificial intelligence to create an accessible mental health solution.

\section{Key Features}

\subsection{AI Voice Therapy}
One of the core innovations of MindfulSpace is its AI-powered voice therapy system. This feature uses:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Speech-to-text conversion using Deepgram API for accurate transcription
