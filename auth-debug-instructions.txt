# Fixing Google Sign-in for MindfulSpace

## Current Issues
1. Plugin error with expo-auth-session (fixed)
2. Google OAuth compliance issues 

## Steps to Fix Google Sign-in

### 1. Update Google Cloud Console Configuration
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Select your project "mindfulspace-956b8"
3. Edit your OAuth Client ID
4. Update the Authorized redirect URIs:
   - https://auth.expo.io/@yashrathore1408/mindfulspace
   - https://mindfulspace-956b8.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler
5. Update Authorized JavaScript origins:
   - https://auth.expo.io
   - https://mindfulspace-956b8.firebaseapp.com

### 2. Configure OAuth Consent Screen
1. Go to "OAuth consent screen" section
2. Ensure app name, user support email, and developer contact info are filled
3. Add scopes: `.../auth/userinfo.email`, `.../auth/userinfo.profile`
4. Add your testing email address under "Test users"
5. Verify your app information is complete
6. Save and continue

### 3. Test with Debugging Screen
1. Import the new debug screen in App.js or your navigation:
   ```javascript
   import GoogleSignInDebug from './GoogleSignInDebug';
   ```

2. Add a route to the debug screen in your navigation:
   ```javascript
   <Stack.Screen name="GoogleDebug" component={GoogleSignInDebug} />
   ```

3. Alternatively, you can directly run it by modifying your App.js temporarily:
   ```javascript
   export default function App() {
     return <GoogleSignInDebug />;
   }
   ```

4. Run the app and use the debug screen to test Google Sign-in
5. Check the logs displayed on screen for any error messages
6. If successful, revert any temporary changes and go back to your normal Login screen

### 4. Common Solutions
- **Error**: "The redirect URI in the request: https://auth.expo.io/@... did not match a registered URI"
  **Solution**: Make sure the Authorized redirect URI in Google Cloud Console includes https://auth.expo.io/@yashrathore1408/mindfulspace

- **Error**: "This app is not verified"
  **Solution**: Add your email as a test user in the OAuth consent screen

- **Error**: "disallowed_useragent" 
  **Solution**: Make sure you're testing on a supported browser/device

### 5. Wait for Propagation
After making changes in Google Cloud Console, it can take 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate. Be patient and try again after waiting.

### 6. Testing
1. Try the GoogleSignInDebug screen first to isolate any issues
2. Once that works, try the actual login button
3. The improved code now includes better error reporting and logging
